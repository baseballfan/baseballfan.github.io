		<h1>Gold Camp Tour</h1>
        <h2>Skill Level: All Abilities</h2>
        <h3>99% Downhill</h3>
		<h4>3-5 hours</h4>
        <p>A completely independent alternative to our ‚ÄúBike Pikes Peak‚Äù tour, this self-paced and self-guided exploration tour follows a historic 1800‚Äôs era mountain locomotive railway. This spectacular two to three hour downhill route traverses a vast canyon wall, passes through several exciting railroad tunnels and offers unforgettable vistas around every bend.</p>
        <p>A well-established gravel path meanders through wild and primitive terrain throughout the ride. We provide all necessary equipment, including mountain transport and an easy-to-follow route map to return you safely back to our base shop.</p>
		<p>This trip starts at the bike shop and is great for families, large group excursions, and newlyweds (and oldlyweds!) who just want to get away from it all. Stop where you want, when you want, and take as long as you want. It‚Äôs all up to you!</p>
		<p><strong>Please Note: This tour is not on Pikes Peak</strong></p>

        <h3>How would you describe a typical tour?</h3>
        
        
        <p>Bike Gold Camp: We meet at our shop at your assigned time to sign release forms and fit you with helmets. We then load into our 15 passenger vans and head off for the tour. When we reach the drop off point we get the bikes unloaded as you take in the amazing view of Colorado Springs from the Front Range. We then get everyone fitted with bikes and go over a detailed safety briefing. During this safety briefing we will explain how to change a flat if you end up being one of the unfortunate few! We also talk about the route, braking, shifting and encourage ‚Äúleave no trace‚Äù ethics. Once the safety briefing is done you are free to head out for your incredible experience! Since this is typically a self guided tour the ‚Äúguide‚Äù will be waiting for you at the shop when you return!</p>
		<p>Bike Pikes Peak: We meet at our shop at your assigned time to eat breakfast, sign release forms and fit you with helmets. We then load into our 15 passenger vans and we head off to the summit of beautiful Pikes Peak or to the Cog depot to drop of the Ride-n-Rail‚Äôers! When we reach the summit, the guides will unload bikes as you take about 15 minutes to experience the awe of the beauty surrounding you. Feel free to visit the gift shop at the summit and try their donuts as they are claimed to be the lightest in the world! Save your money to buy shirts and hoodies from us though so you can brag about biking down Pikes Peak to your friends! üôÇ This time is also a great time to get photo‚Äôs of your group and we are happy to help with this! Once we all gather back at the vans and fitted with bikes we will go over a detailed safety briefing. We will be outlining the rules to help keep everyone safe as well as how to best operate the bikes. From here we start our trip! Either a guide on a bike or in a van will be in front and will set the pace based on conditions and guidelines we must follow. We will take many stops along the way for pictures and a mid-day snack as we traverse our way down this majestic mountain. When we finish up we will take your lunch orders and head on down to Jake and Telly‚Äôs to fill your belly with some amazing food!</p>
